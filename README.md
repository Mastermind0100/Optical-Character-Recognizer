# Optical Character Recognition
This is a code that reads an image and predicts what's written in it. 

## Process 
The code first divides the image into multiple segments (each segment contains a single character). On this segment, a pretrained model is executed to predict the character present in the segment. This then outputs the predicted character in the form of an array (v1.0)
